A simple game of Texas Holdem gambling 
The main goal is to program a gambling game to just get the basic's of the game down. I want to get the cards to appear and run through the steps of the game.
so first draw 2 cards place bet
2nd 3 cards flip bet
3rd another card comes out bet 
4th final card comes out bet and reveal cards to see who the winner will be

This will be me just working on it. I wanted to create my own version of this game because i play a lot of onilne poker and always have been interested in how they made this game virtual. I have found 2 source to work from https://medium.com/@andreasthiele/building-your-own-no-limit-texas-holdem-poker-bot-in-python-cd9919302c1c and a person that has already wrote his own version of a texas holdem game https://delysid.org/pypoker.py . I plan on reviewing these and get an idea of how to go about setting up the program.
